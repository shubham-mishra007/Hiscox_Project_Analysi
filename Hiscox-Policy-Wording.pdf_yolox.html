General conditions
The following conditions apply to the whole of this policy. Any other conditions are shown in the section to which they apply.
Presentation of the risk
1.
In agreeing to insure you and in setting the terms and premium, we have relied on the information you have given us. You must provide a fair presentation of the risk and must take care when answering any questions we ask by ensuring that all information provided is accurate and complete. A fair presentation is one which clearly discloses in a reasonably clear and accessible manner all material facts which you (including your senior management and those responsible for arranging this insurance) know or ought to know following a reasonable search.
If you fail to make a fair presentation
2.
If we establish that you deliberately or recklessly failed to present the risk to us fairly, we may treat this policy as if it never existed and refuse to make any payment under it. You must reimburse all payments already made by us and we will be entitled to retain all premiums paid.
If we establish that you failed to present the risk to us fairly but that your failure was not deliberate or reckless, the remedy we will have available to us will depend upon what we would have done had you made a fair presentation of the risk, as follows:
if we would not have provided this policy, we may treat it as if it never existed and refuse to make any payment under it. You must reimburse all payments already made by us. We will refund any premiums you have paid; or
if we would have provided this policy on different terms (other than as to premium), we will treat it as if it had been provided on such different terms from the start of the period of insurance. This may result in us making no payment for a particular claim or loss. You must reimburse any payment made by us that we would not have paid if such terms had been in effect.
<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Change of circumstances</td><td></td><td></td><td>period may making payment for a particular claim or loss. You must reimburse any payment made by us that we would not have paid if such terms had been in effect.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>You the</td><td>must tell us as soon as reasonably possible of any change in circumstances during period of insurance which may materially affect this policy (a material fact or circumstance is one which might affect our decision to provide insurance or the conditions of that insurance). We may then change the terms and conditions of this policy or cancel it in accordance with the cancellation condition.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="7">If you fail to notify us of a change of circumstances</td><td rowspan="5">4.</td><td>a.</td><td>If we establish that you deliberately or recklessly failed to:</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>i. notify us of a change of circumstances which may materially affect the policy; or</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>ii. comply with the obligation in 1. above to make a fair presentation of the risk to us when providing us with information in relation to a change of circumstances;</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>we may treat this policy as if it no longer existed from the date of such change of circumstances and refuse to make any payment under it in respect of any claim made or any loss occurring after that date. You must reimburse all payments already made by us relating to claims made or losses occurring after such date. We will be entitled to retain all premiums paid.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>b.</td><td>If we establish that you failed to notify us of a change of circumstances or to make a fair presentation of the risk to us when providing us with information in relation to a change of circumstances, but that your failure was not deliberate or reckless, the remedy we will have available to us will depend upon what we would have done had you fairly presented the change of circumstances to us, as follows:</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>i. if we would have cancelled this policy, we may treat it as cancelled from the date that such cancellation would have been effective and refuse to make any payment under it in respect of any claim made or any incident occurring after that date. You must reimburse any payments already made by us relating to claims made or losses occurring after such date. We will refund any premiums you have paid in respect of any period after the date when cancellation would have been effective; or</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>ii. if we would have provided this policy on different terms (other than as to premium), we will treat it as if it had been provided on such different terms from the date when your circumstances changed. This may result in us making no payment for a particular claim or loss.</td></tr><tr><td>Reasonable precautions</td><td></td><td>You in of can</td><td>must take reasonable steps to prevent accident or injury and to protect your property against loss or damage. You must keep any property insured under this policy good condition and repair. We will not make any payment under this policy in respect any incident occurring whilst you are not in compliance with this condition unless you demonstrate that such non-compliance could not have increased the risk of the loss, damage, accident or injury occurring in the circumstances in which it occurred.</td></tr></table>
6. We will not make any payment under this policy until you have paid the premium.
Cancellation
7. You or we can cancel the policy by giving 30 days’ written notice. We will give you a pro-rata refund of the premium for the remaining portion of the period of insurance after the effective date of cancellation for which you have already paid. However, we will not refund any premium under £20.
If we have agreed that you can pay us the premium by instalments and we have not received an instalment 14 days after the due date, we may cancel the policy. In this event, the period of insurance will equate to the period for which premium instalments
<table><thead><th></th><th></th><th>have been paid to us. We will confirm the cancellation and amended period of insurance to you in writing.</th></thead><tr><td rowspan="3">Multiple insureds</td><td></td><td>The most we will pay is the relevant amount shown in the schedule.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>If more than one insured is named in the schedule, the total amount we will pay will not exceed the amount we would be liable to pay to any one of you.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>You agree that the insured named in the schedule, or if there is more than one insured named in the schedule the first of them, is authorised to receive all notices and agree any amendments to the policy.</td></tr><tr><td>Aggregate limit</td><td></td><td>Where this policy specifies an aggregate limit, this means our maximum payment for all relevant claims or losses covered under the policy during the period of insurance.</td></tr><tr><td>Rights of third parties</td><td>10.</td><td>You and we are the only parties to this policy. Nothing in this policy is intended to give any person any right to enforce any term of this policy which that person would not have had but for the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.</td></tr><tr><td>Other insurance</td><td>11.</td><td>We will not make any payment under this policy where you would be entitled to be paid under any other insurance if this policy did not exist except in respect of any amount in excess of the amount that would have been payable under such other insurance had this policy not been effected. If such other insurance is provided by us the most we will pay under this policy will be reduced by the amount payable under such other insurance.</td></tr><tr><td>Cover under multiple sections</td><td>12.</td><td>Where you, including anyone within the meaning of ‘you’ or ‘insured person’ in any section of the policy, are entitled to cover under more than one section of the policy in respect of the same claim or loss, or any part of a claim or loss, we shall only provide cover under</td></tr><tr><td>Governing law</td><td>13.</td><td>to you or the party entitled to cover. Unless some other law is agreed in writing, this policy will be governed by the laws</td></tr><tr><td>Arbitration</td><td>14.</td><td>of England. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this insurance, including over its construction, application and validity, will be referred to a single arbitrator in accordance with the</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Arbitration Act then in force.</td></tr><tr><td>General claims conditions</td><td>The with</td><td>following claims conditions apply to the whole of this policy. You must also comply the conditions shown in each section of the policy under the heading Your obligations.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Your obligations</td><td>1.</td><td>We will not make any payment under this policy unless you:</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>a. give us prompt notice of anything which is likely to give rise to a claim under this policy in accordance with the terms of each section; and</td></tr></table>
give us, at your expense, any information which we may reasonably require and co-operate fully in the investigation of any claim under this policy.
2. You must:
a. make every reasonable effort to minimise any loss, damage or liability and take appropriate emergency measures immediately if they are required to reduce any claim; and
give us all assistance which we may reasonably require to pursue recovery of amounts we may become legally liable to pay under this policy, in your name but at our expense.
If you fail to do so, you shall be liable to us for an amount equal to the detriment we have suffered as a result of your failure to comply with this obligation, which we may deduct from any payment we make under this policy.
Fraud
3.
If you or anyone entitled to cover in respect of any claim or loss, or anyone on behalf of you or such other person, tries to deceive us by deliberately giving us false information or making a fraudulent claim under this policy then:
a. we shall be entitled to give you notice of termination of the policy with effect from
WD-PIP-UK-GTCA(3) 15661 01/21
the date of any fraudulent act or claim or the provision of such false information;
b. we shall be entitled to refuse to make any payment under the policy in respect of any claim made or any loss occurring after the date of any fraudulent act or claim or the provision of such false information;
c. you must reimburse all payments already made by us relating to claims made or losses occurring after the date of any fraudulent act or claim or the provision of such false information; and
d. we shall be entitled to retain all premiums paid.
This does not affect your rights in relation to any claim made or loss occurring before the date of any fraudulent act or claim or the provision of such false information.
4. Where this policy provides cover for any individual who, or entity that, is not a party to the policy, and where such an individual or entity (or anyone on their behalf) tries to deceive us by deliberately giving us false information or making a fraudulent claim under this policy, our rights set out in 3. above apply only to any individual or entity that gave the false information or made the fraudulent claim.

Legal protection Policy wording
DAS can negotiate any claim on behalf of an insured person.
b.
DAS shall choose the appointed representative to represent an insured person in any proceedings where DAS are liable to pay a compensation award. In any other case the insured person is free to choose an appointed representative (by sending DAS a suitably qualified person's name and address) if:
DAS agree to start legal proceedings and it becomes necessary for a lawyer to represent the interests of an insured person in those proceedings; or
there is a conflict of interest.
Before an insured person chooses a lawyer or an accountant, DAS can appoint an appointed representative.
An appointed representative will be appointed by DAS and represent an insured person according to DAS’ standard terms of appointment, which may include a ‘no win, no fee’ agreement. The appointed representative must co-operate fully with DAS at all times.
DAS will have direct contact with the appointed representative.
An insured person must give the appointed representative any instructions that DAS require.
5.
An insured person must tell DAS if anyone offers to settle a claim and must not agree to any settlement without the written consent of DAS.
If an insured person does not accept a reasonable offer to settle a claim, DAS may refuse to pay further costs and expenses;
c.
DAS may decide to pay the insured person a reasonable amount subject to the maximum sum recoverable at law in settlement of damages that the insured person is claiming, or which is being claimed against them instead of starting or continuing legal proceedings.
If DAS ask, an insured person must tell the appointed representative to have costs and expenses taxed, assessed or audited.
6.
An insured person must take every step to recover costs and expenses that DAS have to pay and must pay DAS any costs and expenses that are recovered.
If an appointed representative refuses to continue acting for an insured person with good reason or if an insured person dismisses an appointed representative without good reason, the cover DAS provides will end at once, unless DAS agree to appoint another appointed representative.
8.
If an insured person settles a claim or withdraws their claim without DAS’ agreement, or does not give suitable instructions to an appointed representative, the cover DAS provides will end at once and DAS will be entitled to reclaim any costs and expenses paid by DAS.
9.
If there is a disagreement about the way DAS handle a claim that is not resolved through DAS' internal complaints procedure, DAS and the insured person can choose a suitably qualified person to arbitrate. DAS and the insured person must both agree to the choice of this person in writing. Failing this, DAS will ask the president of a national association relevant to the arbitration to choose another suitably qualified person. All costs of resolving the matter must be paid by the party whose argument is rejected. If the decision is not clearly made against either party, the arbitrator will decide how the costs are shared.
10.
DAS may, at their discretion, require the policyholder to obtain an opinion from counsel, at the policyholder's expense, as to the merits of a claim or proceedings. If counsel's opinion indicates that there are reasonable grounds for the pursuit or defence of a claim or proceedings, the cost of obtaining the opinion will be paid by DAS.
